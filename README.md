<h1>GW0742 vs YK11 – My Experience and Honest Breakdown</h1>

<p>If you’ve been experimenting with SARMs or SARM-like compounds like I have, you’ve probably heard of <strong>GW0742</strong> and <strong>YK11</strong>. I ran both individually across different cycles—one during a cut and one during a bulk—and I’ve got a solid feel for how they compare.</p>

<p>This article will break down <strong>how each one worked for me, what they’re best for, and what to expect</strong> if you decide to run either compound. Also, if you’re ready to buy, I’ve linked the exact sources I use for purity and reliability.</p>

<h2>GW0742 – The Next Gen Fat Loss Compound</h2>

<p><strong>GW0742</strong> is a <strong>PPARδ agonist</strong>—similar to Cardarine (GW501516)—but with a few tweaks. I tested this compound at <strong>15mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a cut. I was eating 500 calories below maintenance with high protein and moderate cardio.</p>

<h3>My Results on GW0742:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fat started melting off around week 2</li>
  <li>Endurance during fasted cardio increased big time</li>
  <li>No loss of strength despite calorie deficit</li>
  <li>No crash or stim jitters</li>
  <li>Vascularity and muscle definition got sharper</li>
</ul>

<p>GW0742 is basically like a <strong>fat-burning endurance booster</strong>. It doesn’t build muscle directly, but it <strong>preserves muscle while you cut</strong>. I also noticed better pumps than I expected. It’s ideal for <strong>cutting or recomp</strong>, especially if you’re doing cardio or performance-based training.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Extreme fat loss</li>
  <li>No suppression</li>
  <li>Endurance goes through the roof</li>
  <li>Great muscle preservation during a cut</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not a muscle-building compound</li>
  <li>Pumps can fade if carbs get too low</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Cutting, Endurance, Cardio-heavy routines</p>

<h2>YK11 – My Go-To for Serious Muscle Gains</h2>

<p><strong>YK11</strong> is a monster compound. It acts as a <strong>myostatin inhibitor</strong>, helping unlock growth you can’t get naturally. I used it at <strong>10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a lean bulk with 300–400 calories over maintenance. This was one of the strongest compounds I’ve tested solo.</p>

<h3>My Results on YK11:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Noticeable size increase after 10–14 days</li>
  <li>Muscle density and hardness skyrocketed</li>
  <li>Strength increases in every major lift</li>
  <li>Pumps were insane—had to drop volume some days</li>
  <li>Suppression hit slightly in week 5</li>
</ul>

<p>YK11 is not for beginners. It works fast and hard, but it’s <strong>not side-effect free</strong>. I noticed some fatigue and light suppression toward the end, and I ran a light PCT after. But the muscle gains? Real. You don’t get this kind of density from Ostarine or Ligandrol alone.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Crazy lean muscle growth</li>
  <li>Strength and power jumps</li>
  <li>Great for hard gainers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Suppression kicks in late cycle</li>
  <li>Needs post-cycle therapy</li>
  <li>Can feel lethargic without enough carbs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Bulking, Strength Gains, Advanced Users</p>

<h2>GW0742 vs YK11 – Direct Comparison</h2>

<p>These two aren’t meant for the same thing. One is for fat loss and conditioning. The other is for serious muscle growth. Here's a direct breakdown based on my personal results:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Compound</th>
      <th>Main Goal</th>
      <th>Muscle Gain</th>
      <th>Fat Loss</th>
      <th>Suppression</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>GW0742</strong></td>
      <td>Cutting / Endurance</td>
      <td>Low</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>None</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>YK11</strong></td>
      <td>Bulking / Strength</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>Medium (with diet)</td>
      <td>Moderate</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>My advice: if you're trying to <strong>shred fat, hold onto muscle, and boost endurance</strong>, go GW0742. If you want <strong>size, strength, and don’t mind a mini PCT</strong>, YK11 is hard to beat.</p>

<h2>How I Test My SARMs</h2>

<p>I always run compounds solo for the first cycle. I log daily notes on strength, mood, appetite, recovery, and gym performance. I also get <strong>pre- and post-cycle bloodwork</strong>—I don’t mess around when it comes to health.</p>

<p>And yeah, I’ve had a few trial-and-error cycles. But that’s how I know what works. What I’m writing here is all personal experience—not regurgitated info from Reddit threads.</p>

<h2>FAQs – GW0742 vs YK11</h2>

<h3>Is GW0742 a SARM?</h3>
<p>No. It’s a PPARδ agonist, similar to Cardarine. It doesn’t build muscle but helps with fat loss and endurance.</p>

<h3>Does GW0742 need a PCT?</h3>
<p>No. It’s non-suppressive and doesn’t mess with hormone levels.</p>

<h3>Does YK11 build more muscle than other SARMs?</h3>
<p>Yes. In my experience, YK11 builds more dense muscle than Ostarine, LGD-4033, or even RAD140.</p>

<h3>Can you stack GW0742 and YK11?</h3>
<p>You can. One helps burn fat and preserve endurance while the other builds muscle. Just monitor for suppression from YK11.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If you’re in a <strong>cutting phase or do a lot of cardio/conditioning</strong>, <strong>GW0742</strong> is a clean, non-suppressive way to burn fat and hold onto muscle. If you’re looking for <strong>serious gains and strength with some risk of suppression</strong>, <strong>YK11</strong> delivers—but it’s not for everyone.</p>

<p>I personally use both depending on the cycle. Just make sure to run bloodwork, track your progress, and don’t abuse these compounds. They work—but only if you’re smart about it.</p>
